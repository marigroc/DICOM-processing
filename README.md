# USToolbox

## Overview

This comprehensive suite of programs is specifically designed to revolutionize and streamline the quality control (QC) procedures in ultrasound (US) imaging. Traditionally, QC in ultrasound has been a labour-intensive process, relying on manual measurements conducted by human observers. However, our innovative program introduces a sophisticated and automated alternative that increases efficiency and enhances the QC process's objectivity.

## Features

- **Automated Analysis:** The suite automates the analysis of captured US images.
  
- **Performance Parameters:** It estimates key performance parameters, including resolution, penetration depths, and high and low contrast sensitivity.

- **Test Object:** Utilizes the Multipurpose Phantom for standardized image acquisition.

## Usage

1. **Image Acquisition:**
   - Capture images of the test object on an ultrasound scanner.
   - Transfer the DICOM study to the PC with the USToolbox software.

2. **Automated Tests:**
   - Apply the suite for automated tests covering resolution, low- and high-contrast penetration, and low- and high-contrast sensitivity.

3. **Validation:**
   - Preliminary validation involves images from different probes operating at various frequencies.
   - The system provides 95% confidence intervals for the measurements.

4. **Multicentre Validation:**
   - Ongoing validation includes a multicentre approach to ensure reliability across different settings.

## Significance

- **Improved Reproducibility:** The suite enhances reproducibility, reducing intraobserver and interobserver variation.

- **Increased Information:** Detailed information on the visibility of targets is provided, offering advantages over visual assessments.

- **Multicentre Validation:** Ongoing validation efforts underscore the commitment to ensuring system reliability.
